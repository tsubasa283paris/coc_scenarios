- `README.md`  
  Here.
- `distributed/`  
  The directory containing scenarios that are distributed by someone on the Internet.  
  The scenarios below this folder must refer to the original URL.  
  Some of them are edited from the each original one so I / you can easily keep a session.
- `evaluation.md`  
  It gives my evaluations on all scenarios, based on an actual session.
- `musics.md`  
  It gives some good musics from YouTube.  
  Intend to use them on a Discord App "Rythm".
- `original/`  
  The directory containing scenarios that are my original scenarios.

## Images

You can find some images for scenarios on my pixiv account (**To be described in future**).  
The URLs for them are (**To Be**) described in each scenario.

## License

All of my `original` scenarios are free to use, edit and re-distribute.

`distributed` scenarios are derived from somewhere and the licenses depend.  
Safe not to edit and re-distribute.
